# Mutation-Testing
A simulation of how mutation testing is done on a single source code file. 
- I have utilized the Python AST module to manipulate the source code and create first level mutated files. 

Must have downloaded the Python3 AST module with pip3 as well as astpretty before running the command below.
The command to run this program please use this command:

python3 mutate.py fuzzywuzzy.py {any number > 0}
